# S7_labworks

The goal of this repository is to list some of the labworks I was able to do during the 7th semester of my Msc in Software Engineering at Université Paul Sabatier - Toulouse.

This repository does not show one of the part of the "Applications frontales" module, allowing a front-end implementation in Vue.js in the context of a dynamic web application of the "Single Page Application" type.
