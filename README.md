# S7_SDL

The goal of this repository is to list some of the labworks I was able to do during the 7th semester of the Master mention Informatique, parcours SDL, at Université Paul Sabatier - Toulouse.

This repository does not show the labworks of the following modules completed during the semester:
 
- the "UI/UX et applications frontales" module, allowing :

1. the mastery of the principles of design, programming and evaluation of user interfaces and interaction techniques, with the aim of producing usable computer systems
2. the study of client-side languages (front end) and the implementation of the framework Vue.js in the context of a dynamic web application of the "Single Page Application" type.

- the "Théorie des langages" module, allowing

1. the study of the functioning of a compiler and its architecture through the use of the Ocaml functional language
2. an introduction to the Coq proof environment and the verification of a semantic-preserving transformation
