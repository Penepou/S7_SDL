# S7_labworks

The goal of this repository is to list some of the labworks I was able to do during the 7th semester of the Master mention Informatique, parcours SDL, at Université Paul Sabatier - Toulouse.

This repository does not show the labworks of the the "UI/UX et applications frontales" module, allowing :

1. the mastery of the principles of design, programming and evaluation of user interfaces and interaction techniques, with the aim of producing usable computer systems
2. the study of client-side languages (front end) and the implementation of the framework Vue.js in the context of a dynamic web application of the "Single Page Application" type.
